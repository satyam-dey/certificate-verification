# 🎓 Certificate Verification System

A web-based certificate verification system developed for **Vault of Codes**, enabling users to verify the authenticity of issued certificates quickly and securely.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Verify certificate by entering unique ID
- 🔒 Validates against a predefined list/database (mock/demo data)
- 🖥️ Simple and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 📦 Lightweight and easy to deploy
- 📸 Brand logo integrated

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
certificate-verification/
│
├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── style.css # Styling for the UI
├── script.js # JavaScript for certificate verification logic
├── logo.png # Organization logo
└── README.md # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The user enters a **certificate ID** in the input field.
2. On submission, the script checks the entered ID against a predefined list (can be extended to backend or API).
3. If valid, a success message is shown; otherwise, an error is displayed.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Backend integration with database (MongoDB / Firebase / Supabase)
- Admin panel to add/remove certificate IDs
- Downloadable certificate PDF preview
- Email verification integration
